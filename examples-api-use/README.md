Running some demos
------------------
Let's start by running some demos, then we can dive into code. The
[demo-main.cc](demo-main.cc) has some testing demos. Via command line flags,
you can choose the display type you have (16x32 or 32x32), and how many you
have chained and paralleled. For detailed description of these flags see the
[main README section](../README.md#changing-parameters-via-command-line-flags)
about it.

```

Demos, choosen with -D
        0  - some rotating square
        1  - forward scrolling an image (-m <scroll-ms>)
        2  - backward scrolling an image (-m <scroll-ms>)
        3  - test image: a square
        4  - Pulsing color
        5  - Grayscale Block
        6  - Abelian sandpile model (-m <time-step-ms>)
        7  - Conway's game of life (-m <time-step-ms>)
        8  - Langton's ant (-m <time-step-ms>)
        9  - Volume bars (-m <time-step-ms>)
        10 - Evolution of color (-m <time-step-ms>)
        11 - Brightness pulse generator
Example:
        ./demo -D 1 runtext.ppm
Scrolls the runtext until Ctrl-C is pressed
```

To run the actual demos, you need to run this as root so that the
GPIO pins can be accessed; as soon as that established, the program will drop
the privileges.

Here is how demo '1' looks. It requires a ppm (type raw) with a height of
32 pixel - it is infinitely scrolled over the screen; for
convenience, there is a little runtext.ppm example included:

     $ sudo ./demo -D 1 runtext.ppm

Here is a video of how it looks

Other Examples
--------------

There are a few other examples that you can use as starting point for your
own exploration of the API. If you just type `make` in this directory, the
Makefile will build all of these, so they are ready to use. Some examples
need BDF fonts, of which there are a few provided in [../fonts](../fonts).

Some of these example programs are described in more detail further down this
page.

 * [minimal-example](./minimal-example.cc) Good to get started with the API
 * [image-example](./image-example.cc) How to show an image (requires to install the graphics magic library, see in the header of that demo)
 * [text-example](./text-example.cc) Reads text from stdin and displays it.
 * [scrolling-text-example](./scrolling-text-example.cc) Scrolls a text
   given on the command-line.
 * [clock](./clock.cc) Shows a clock with choosable date format string in
   one or multiple lines.
 * [input-example](./input-example.cc) Example how to use the LED-Matrix but
   also read inputs from free GPIO-pins. Needed if you build some interactive
   piece.
 * [ledcat](./ledcat.cc) LED-cat compatible reading of pixels from stdin.
 * [pixel-mover](./pixel-mover.cc) Displays pixel on the display
   and it's expected position on the terminal. Helpful for testing panels and
   figuring out new multiplexing mappings.
   Shows single dot or leaves a trail with length passed with `-t` option
   (think of 'snake').
   Can move around the pixel with W=Up, S=Down, A=Left, D=Right keys.

Using the API
-------------
While there is the demo program and the [utilities](../utils), this code can
be used independently as a library to be used in your own programs.
The includes are in `include/`, the library to link is built
in `lib/`. This is a C++ also with C bindings. There is also a
[Python](../bindings/python) and [c#](../bindings/c%23) bindings.

Getting started
---------------
The relevant part to start with is to look at
[led-matrix.h](../include/led-matrix.h).

You can would typically use the `RGBMatrix::CreateFromFlags()` factory to
create an RGBMatrix and then go from there.

```C++
#include "led-matrix.h"

using rgb_matrix::RGBMatrix;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  // Set some defaults
  RGBMatrix::Options my_defaults;
  my_defaults.hardware_mapping = "regular";  // or e.g. "adafruit-hat" or "adafruit-hat-pwm"
  my_defaults.chain_length = 3;
  my_defaults.show_refresh_rate = true;
  rgb_matrix::RuntimeOptions runtime_defaults;
  // If you drop privileges, the root user you start the program with
  // to be able to initialize the hardware will be switched to an unprivileged
  // user to minimize a potential security attack surface.
  runtime_defaults.drop_privileges = 1;
  RGBMatrix *matrix = RGBMatrix::CreateFromFlags(&argc, &argv,
                                                 &my_defaults,
                                                 &runtime_defaults);
  if (matrix == NULL) {
    PrintMatrixFlags(stderr, my_defaults, runtime_defaults);
    return 1;
  }

  // matrix->ApplyPixelMapper(...);  // Optional

  // Do your own command line handling with the remaining options.

  //  .. now use matrix

  delete matrix;   // Make sure to delete it in the end.
}
```

The `RGBMatrix` is essentially a canvas, it provides some basic functionality
such as `SetPixel()`, `Fill()` or `Clear()`. If you want to do more, you
might be interested in functions provided in the
[graphics.h](../include/graphics.h) header.

If you have animations, you might be interested in double-buffering. There is
a way to create new canvases with `CreateFrameCanvas()`, and then use
`SwapOnVSync()` to change the content atomically. See API documentation for
details.

Start with the [minimal-example.cc](./minimal-example.cc) to start.

If you are interested in drawing text and the font drawing functions in
graphics.h, have a look at the [text example](./text-example.cc):

```
sudo ./text-example -f ../fonts/8x13.bdf
hello
```

<img src="../img/text-no-ghosting.jpg" height="100px">

How about a clock ?

```
sudo ./clock -f ../fonts/7x13.bdf --led-chain=2 -d "%A" -d "%H:%M:%S"
```
<img src="../img/time-display.jpg" height="100px">

Fonts are in a human readable and editbable `*.bdf` format. There are some
public domain fonts available in the [`../fonts/`](../fonts) directory. Any
other fonts you might want to use or scale to the size you need can be
converted to a BDF format (either with a font editor or the [otf2bdf] tool).

Here is an example how you could create a 30pixel high BDF font from some
TrueType font:

```bash
otf2bdf -v -o myfont.bdf -r 72 -p 30 /path/to/font-Bold.ttf
```

Integrating in your own application
-----------------------------------
Until this library shows up in your favorite Linux distribution, you can just
include the library via github; it is pretty easy to be up-to-date.

I suggest to add this code as a sub-module in your git repository. That way
you can use that particular version and easily update it if there are changes:

     git submodule add https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.git matrix

(Read more about how to use [submodules in git][git-submodules])

This will check out the repository in a subdirectory `matrix/`.
The library to build would be in directory `matrix/lib`, so let's hook that
into your toplevel Makefile.
I suggest to set up some variables like this; you only need to change the
location `RGB_LIB_DISTRIBUTION` is pointing to; in the sub-module example, this
was the `matrix` directory:

     RGB_LIB_DISTRIBUTION=matrix
     RGB_INCDIR=$(RGB_LIB_DISTRIBUTION)/include
     RGB_LIBDIR=$(RGB_LIB_DISTRIBUTION)/lib
     RGB_LIBRARY_NAME=rgbmatrix
     RGB_LIBRARY=$(RGB_LIBDIR)/lib$(RGB_LIBRARY_NAME).a
     LDFLAGS+=-L$(RGB_LIBDIR) -l$(RGB_LIBRARY_NAME) -lrt -lm -lpthread

Also, you want to add a target to build the libary in your sub-module

	 # (FYI: Make sure, there is a TAB-character in front of the $(MAKE))
     $(RGB_LIBRARY):
		 $(MAKE) -C $(RGB_LIBDIR)

Now, your final binary needs to depend on your objects and also the
`$(RGB_LIBRARY)`

     my-binary : $(OBJECTS) $(RGB_LIBRARY)
	     $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@ $(LDFLAGS)

As an example, see the [PixelPusher implementation][pixelpush] which is using
this library in a git sub-module.

If you are writing your own Makefile, make sure to pass the `-O3` option to
the compiler to make sure to generate fast code.

Note, all the types provided are in the `rgb_matrix` namespace. That way, they
won't clash with other types you might use in your code; in particular pretty
common names such as `GPIO` or `Canvas` might run into clashing trouble.

Anyway, for convenience you just might add using-declarations in your
code:

     // Types exported by the RGB-Matrix library.
     using rgb_matrix::Canvas;
     using rgb_matrix::GPIO;
     using rgb_matrix::RGBMatrix;

Or, if you are lazy, just import the whole namespace:

     using namespace rgb_matrix;

Read the [`minimal-example.cc`](./minimal-example.cc) to get started, then
have a look into [`demo-main.cc`](./demo-main.cc).
